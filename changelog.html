					The first version of the Pronoun Testing Grounds. Includes
					basic pronouns and six random stories. The pronoun input
					helpful placeholder text (with example pronouns put in a
					random order) and (on desktop) hover messages. There is
					also a couple of footnotes explaining a couple of the weird
					pronoun options. Some of the example pronouns are chosen
					randomly from a list, such as himself/hisself, and
					reflexive they/them pronouns.

				* You may be wondering what the difference between the
				possesseive determiner and the possessive pronoun is. That's a
				good question. There doesn't seem to be one. I think it's a
				remnant of Old English. I wish it didn't exist because it's
				much harder to come up with stories with it in there. General
				rule of thumb: The possessive determiner comes before the verb,
				and the possessive pronoun comes after the verb.
			</p>
			<p>** The plural is mostly used for people who use they/them
				pronouns. Some people like to use singular verbs with these
				pronouns. For example, "They is happy" vs "They are happy".
				Another example: "They wakes up in the morning" vs "They wake
				up in the morning". If you're confused about which one to use,
				then unless you're using they/them pronouns, you're probably
				gonna want "singular".
